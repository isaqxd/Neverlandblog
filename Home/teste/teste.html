        <p class="parag">
          In the wake of his mother's death and his father's remarriage, a
          headstrong boy named Mahito ventures into a dreamlike world shared by
          both the living and the dead.

        <p class="parag">
          Seeing The Boy and The Heron, Hayao Miyazaki's latest movie feels
          almost like a monumental event in and of itself. It was announced
          almost as a surprise with the words "Hayao Miyazaki's last movie".
          With this amount of hype, including the amazing reviews it's got from
          critics, my hype was built up to the max. The end result? Not what I
          expected, and that's ok!  Let's get to the positives, the animation is
          STUNNING. The way Hayao Miyazaki manages to build these worlds and
          characters is just an amazing feat, they all come alive with the
          colours and the movement. Another positive is the tone of the movie, I
          really hate Disney for trying to market this as a kid's movie, when
          it's not. It's got some unnerving and scary moments and themes that
          are not suited for kids, which is good. Hayao Miyazaki is at his best
          when he manages to blend the adult with the fantastical.
